    <h4>Know why we sign in?</h4>
    <p>
        We sign in because, my dear sir. Simply because. Because that's how the world turns and
		the winds blow. <small>or is it?</small> Oh goodness! Did someone say that! Well, since 
		the truth is coming out... that's right folks. We don't sign in because the world turns.
		We sign in because computer sciences decided how the internet turns. And by that, I mean
		they <i>probably</i> tried to find the best way to manage this monster that has been created.
		Hence, databases that store all that good old information belonging to you. And to get that 
		info, you gots to sign in, man. And if you don't have an account - go to the sign up page bro!

		To make you feel a little better about this sad situation, I'll quote some words from a 
		wonderful song by Sir Eric Clapton. I am actually not sure if Eric Clapton is knighted or 
		not. That is, if he is technically referred to as "Sir" by the British Government. However,
		I would like to think that <b> Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II</b> (may she rest in peace)
		did, in fact, knight him. I mean, she knighted Paul McCartney. Did she knight George Harrison?
		Or was she a little late on that train? Man, if I knew, I think we'd be closer to solving the 
		Clapton ordeal. Considering they were friends and all. I mean, not really sure what happened
		with the wife situation but guitar game recognizes guitar game. If you're curious about this,
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Clapton#">you can read more</a>. And anyway,
		to get back to the original point, he said "Let it Grow". So go forth, and let your own 
		database entry grow by signing in.
