    <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>
        Just the standard privacy policy here. I'm told I have to have one. Nothing personal, of course.
		Or, I mean, the privacy policy is actually about personal information. So it is personal.
		But it's not personal that I have a policy. I hope that made sense. Words can be so fickle,
		but that's what makes them so good for poetry. Which you will see... maybe. If you are 
		approved. Of course, I'll need some personal information to approve you.
	</p>

	    <h4>Presented:</h4>
	<nl>
		<li>if you create an account, your account info can be stored</li>
		<li>cookies may collect your cookie crumbs</li>
	</nl>

	<br>

	<p> If you keep using my site, I have to assume you are <u>ok</u> with this privacy policy! 
		Especially if you create an account. I mean, you're literally creating an account!
		Obviously the idea is that I store some information. However, as I've stated, I have 
		to verify you are a) not a <u>liar</u> and b) pretty <i>cool!</i> So be patient.
		The poetry is maybe coming. If I've verified these two things about you, you should no 
		doubt know to protect the valuable poetry. Privacy <small>can</small> go both ways, you know.
		It just usually doesn't.
