    <h3>Sign In</h3>

    <h4>Why sign in?</h4>
    <p>
        I know what you're thinking. <i>"Sign up? Why on earth would I do that?!"</i>
		And to be honest with you, I don't have a good answer for you. Sometimes things
		like this are out of our hands. We are but slaves to the whims of our higher ups.
		But one thing about me is, that I can spin. Oh I can spin. It'd be hard not to spin
		on a webpage such as this. So do me a favor and sit back while I spin some magic
		to get that word count up. <u>And get ready to be convinved</u>
    </p>

	<p>
		<b>Why sign up??</b> Well, I'm so glad you asked. Because you might as well acknowledge
		that we already know you're here. Gee, the whole internet really knows you're here. There's 
		no way not to be tracked, you know. So do us both a favor, take the control back. Fool yourself
		into thinking <i>you</i> signed in, and not all the cookies on your browser doing it for you.
		Take back the handles on this thing you call browsing man! And yeah, it might be a placebo effect.
		But don't you know those lowkey work?! Alright. Now get to it soldier. Make me proud.
