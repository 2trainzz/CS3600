    <h3>Terms and Conditions</h3>

    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>
        My terms and conditions are pretty basic. They are listed below. If you are concerned
		about any of them, I'd like to ask you <i>why</i>. Because they're pretty basic. I mean,
		did you really read the terms of getting a microsoft account that much in detail? I bet not.
		But I'm not trying to attack you - lord (or should I say Bill) knows <b>I</b> didn't read them.
		My point is you're constantly under way more terms than you even realize. So don't stress.
		I have practically no crazy terms or conditions.
    </p>

	    <h4>Presented:</h4>
	<nl>
		<li>be truthful</li>
		<li>no soup slander (even in your head)</li>
		<li>This site is my own and you can't copy it!</li>
		<li>Your account on this site is not heavily protected, so don't enter 
			valuable information unless you want to take that risk!
		</li>
	</nl>

	<br>

	<p> If you keep using my site, I have to assume you are <u>ok</u> with these terms and 
		conditions! Common practice, really. The internet is really something, really something
		I tell you. In fact, I'm using 50 words to tell you this! If you know, you know why there's
		50 words. At the end of the day, I'm just trying to get all my marks, you know. I'm not
		a front end fan. But I will do it. Cause I'm committed. Committed I say!
