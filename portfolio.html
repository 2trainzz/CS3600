    <h3>Portfolio</h3>

    <h4>Experience</h4>
    <p>
        Carla has interned at Avangrid as a part of their Technical Systems team. 
        This team was an interally focused team that looked for ways to improve
        or streamline performance within the company, usually in terms of software.
        This was a useful internship, but it taught Carla she didn't want to work
        front end. Exactly why this assignment is so painful.

    <p>
        Recently, Carla interned at H&H, where she learned a lot about patent engineering. 
        This was much more personally rewarding to her. She responded to Patent Office Actions
        and read many, many patents. So many patents. Because that's what patent engineers do! 
        This taught her a lot about patenting, and about the stuff that those patents were on!
        Unfortunately, this information cannot be revealed because it was top secret. Just know
        there was a lot of learning going on.

    <h4>Coursework</h4>
    <p>
        Below is a short list of the classes that Carla has taken. Of course, these are 
        not all the classes she has taken, nor will they be the last. That said, as Carla
        is a senior, she probably won't be taking a crazy amount of classes after this year.
        Maybe some ballroom dancing classes. Or knitting. We shall see.
        Back to these courses listed below though, they are the pretty important classes that 
        she has taken <i>in terms of her degree</i>.
