    <h3>Cookie Policy</h3>

    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>
        Just the standard cookie policy here. I'm told I have to have one. Nothing personal, of course.
		Well, actually, the cookie policy is kind of about your information. So it is personal.
		But it's not personal that I have a policy. I hope that made sense. Words can be so wiley,
		but that is what makes them so good for poetry. Which you might see... maybe. If you are 
		approved. Of course, I'll need some personal information to approve you. And that personal 
		information may be collected via cookies.
	</p>

	    <h4>Presented:</h4>
	<nl>
		<li>cookies may collect your cookie crumbs</li>
		<li>They will be used to verify you're poetry eligibility</li>
		<li>They will not be used for anything else</li>
	</nl>

	<br>

	<p> If you keep using my site, I have to assume you are <u>good</u> with this cookie policy! 
		Obviously the idea is that I store some information in order 
		to verify you are a) not a <u>liar</u> and b) pretty <i>cool!</i> So be patient.
		The poetry is maybe coming. If I've verified these two things about you, you should no 
		doubt know to protect the valuable poetry. Privacy <small>can</small> go both ways, you know.
		It just usually doesn't. For example, you don't get any of <i>my</i> cookies. Especially
		not my pumpkin ones.
